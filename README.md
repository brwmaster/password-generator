# Password generator

This is the fifth project in the **100 days of code: The complete Python Bootcamp for 2022**

On the fifth day we create a simple cli Password generator that let the user create theire own **password** based on 3 questions.

1. How many letters
2. How many special chars
3. How many numbers

Based on those questions every single time a random password will be generated.
